DB_NAME=library_system
```

---

## 🧪 Testing the M-Pesa Endpoint

Use Postman or curl:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/mpesa/confirm \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "TransactionType": "Pay Bill",
    "TransID": "ABC123XYZ",
    "TransTime": "20250826132500",
    "TransAmount": "100",
    "BusinessShortCode": "123456",
    "MSISDN": "254712345678",
    "FirstName": "Martin"
  }'
```

Expected response:

```json
{
  "ResultCode": 0,
  "ResultDesc": "Accepted"
}
```

## 🧠 System Logic

1. Receive POST from M-Pesa at `/mpesa/confirm`
2. Validate payload and sanitize input
3. Log transaction to database
4. Trigger frontend update (toast + sound)
5. Respond with ResultCode 0 to acknowledge receipt

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

| Issue                          | Fix                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Cannot POST /mpesa/confirm%0A` | Remove newline (`%0A`) from URL — ensure clean endpoint in Postman |
| DB not connecting              | Check `.env` credentials and DB server status                      |
| No frontend update             | Confirm WebSocket or polling logic is active                       |
